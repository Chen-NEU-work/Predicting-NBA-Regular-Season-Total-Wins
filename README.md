# Predicting-NBA-Regular-Season-Total-Wins
Predict NBA teams' total wins.
To get the baseline results, first open the file “NBA total wins (Baseline).py”. Then open the project folder by selecting “NBA total wins prediction”. Ensure that the required data files, including “NBA_Last10_2017_2022.csv” and other associated datasets, are placed within the project directory. Once the data files are properly included, run the code to obtain the R² and RMSE values for each model, as well as the predictions for the 2023 NBA season.
